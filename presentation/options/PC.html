                            The Escapists provides players the opportunity of
                            experiencing a light-hearted insight into everyday
                            prison life with the main objective being that of
                            escaping! Players will have to keep in line and
                            juggle their time sensibly as they form their
                            personal plan of escape; working out potential
                            routes to use as well as being incredibly smart and
                            clever in using what seem like harmless items to
                            craft and create various weaponry and escape tools
                            which help aid the player in their ultimate goal of
                            escaping. Players are tasked with advancing their
                            character’s statistics through various means such as
                            exercising regularly and ensuring to boost their
                            intellect as well… Whilst remembering to attend roll
                            call, hold down their job and keep the inmates on
                            side if you’re to be successful in trading with them
                            and ultimately… Don’t forget to escape!

                            Cities: Skylines is a modern take on the classic
                            city simulation. The game introduces new game play
                            elements to realize the thrill and hardships of
                            creating and maintaining a real city whilst
                            expanding on some well-established tropes of the
